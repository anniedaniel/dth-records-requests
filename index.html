        <h1>DTH Records Requests</h1>
          <p class="lead">An investigation on The Daily Tar Heel's records requests to various departments within UNC Chapel Hill.</p>
      </div>

<p>On average, it takes the UNC records office about 69 days to answer a records request sent by The Daily Tar Heel.</p>

<p>But that’s only if the University responds to a request with records. In an analysis of every records request sent from a DTH reporter to the UNC records office from September 2009 to April 2014, a team of reporters found that only 68 percent of the requests sent resulted in records.</p>

<p>The length of time it takes to receive records and the uncertainty involved in making a request makes reporting more difficult for DTH staffers.</p>

<p>“I feel like they leave you in the dark after you make a request,” said Amanda Albright, university editor for the 2013-14 school year. “Every time I get a request back, it’s like Christmas and I’m shocked.”</p>

<p>Yet public records have proven key to DTH investigations over the last four years.</p>

<p>In 2010, the <a href="http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2010/10/media_organizations_file_suit_against_unc_officials" target="_blank">DTH, News & Observer and six other news organizations sued</a> Athletic Director Dick Baddour, football head coach Butch Davis, Director of Public Safety Jeff McCracken and Chancellor Holden Thorp over records relating to the football scandal.</p>

<p>The news organizations sought unredacted phone records for cell phones issued to Davis, Baddour and former associate coach John Blake and employment information for tutors and mentors employed by the University, among other records.</p>

<p>“I think that in general the University has tried very hard not to release public records related to the scandal,” said Erica Perel, newsroom adviser at the DTH. “In doing so, they’ve released them slowly and only when they’ve had to.”</p>

<p>University officials claimed they could not release the documents because the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a federal student privacy law known as FERPA, prevented them from doing so.</p>

<p>Superior Court Judge Howard Manning disagreed with that notion.</p>

<p>Manning ordered UNC to turn over the records to the media outlets and <a href="http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/10/university-settles-in-football-lawsuit" target="_blank">UNC settled with the media companies in 2012</a>. The University agreed not to appeal Manning’s ruling and to pay the media outlets $45,000. In return, the media outlets agreed not to post the complete interviews with football players online.</p>

<p>Despite the judge’s order, record requests from as far back as 2010 are still outstanding. </p>

<p>Sara Gregory, the DTH’s community manager in 2010, filed a request for copies of the visitor sign-in sheets at Kenan Football Center, the University’s written appeal to the NCAA regarding the sanctions levied on Kendric Burney and Deunta Williams and other documents on Sept. 28, 2010.</p>

<p>“They should have given us the records immediately,” Perel said.</p>

<p>More than 1,300 days later, that request is still outstanding.</p>

<p>Albright said her biggest frustration wasn’t FERPA during the 2013-14 school year, but a lack of transparency.</p>

<p>“If I request a bunch of emails, I know it’s going to take more than a year,” she said. “They don’t give a timetable when they respond. I don’t think they’re very clear.”</p>

<p>Albright mentioned that many town governments put their email records online so they do not have to manually find records that reporters and citizens are looking for.</p>

<p>“The city desk has access to all of the town officials’ emails. When I worked for the Charlotte Observer, it worked in the exact same way,” she said. “It’s very frustrating, because I think it would be very easy to do that with certain administrators.”</p>

<p>It took an average of 53 days for the records office to process a records request made during the 2013-14 school year — but so far only 56 percent of the requests have been fully returned.</p>

<p>During that same period of time, it took nearly three times as long for the records office to return a request that involved emails — but half of those requests are outstanding. </p>

<p>Denise Allen, a public records assistant, declined to comment for this story in a phone interview.</p>

<p>“We are looking into your request and will be back in-touch if we have any questions. The University's Public Records Policy is available on-line at <a href="http://policies.unc.edu/policies/public-records/">http://policies.unc.edu/policies/public-records/</a>,” Allen later replied in an email.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p> Our group wanted to organize and visualize public records requests made by the Daily Tar Heel over the past four and a half years. The idea was to visually represent how many records requests were filled, not filled or denied, and to show what types of records were requested. First, we gathered emails of records requests sent by DTH reporters from September 2009 to April 2014. Most group members were responsible for reading through about 50 emails each and adding information about the requests to a Google spreadsheet. This information included the content of the request, the date the request was made, the success status of the request, the date a successful request was received, and appropriate tags for the request (such as Sports, Reports, Budgets). The information was then used to create the visuals you see on this site.</p>
